# Django Caching

### What is Cache?
1. In general, cache means hidden.
2. In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

### Why cache is required?
A cache's primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.
